      <h1>Goals</h1>

      <h4>external</h4>
      <p>
        I want to contribute and make a lasting impact on the world and future. In my opinion research and taking risks on projects is the best way to do that.
        I also want to do my best to make the world a great place to live and always try to maximize the joy for people around me.
      </p>

      <h4>personal</h4>
      <p>continuing to improve myself, building a real legacy to be remembered for, giving back to the world, having a nice family</p>

      <h4>why?</h4>
      <p>
        Yeah, I don't know. I have had this mindset for a long time. I guess I have always loved working on projects and tinkering with stuff. My time spent online then led me to computer science and science in general.
        I formed my goal after I watched
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Vsauce" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
          style="color:#1a73e8;text-decoration:none;"
          onmouseover="this.style.textDecoration='underline'"
          onmouseout="this.style.textDecoration='none'">
          Vsauce
        </a>
        and
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@SciShow" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
          style="color:#1a73e8;text-decoration:none;"
          onmouseover="this.style.textDecoration='underline'"
          onmouseout="this.style.textDecoration='none'">
          SciShow
        </a>
        on YouTube for a long time and found my admiration for science and tech.
      </p>

      <h4>some thoughts I once heard in a YouTube video that stuck with me</h4>
      <p>
        I grew up in a rich country with supportive parents and friends. Of course I have had my own struggles in life but I felt like throwing away that opportunity would be incredibly selfish.
        A lot of people have the potential to contribute to the world but their circumstances keep them trapped and unable to do so. I don't know if I have it in me to do that, but the least I can do is try.
        If I were to do the bare minimum, never take risks and stop growing, I would feel like I am taking away the opportunity someone else could have used to make the world a better place.
